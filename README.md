# STR Dashboard Project

# Overview  
This project focuses on building a Short Term Rental (STR) Dashboard using the provided dataset.  
The goal is to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as occupancy, revenue, and average daily rate (ADR) to help property managers and stakeholders make data driven business decisions.

# Project
Data Source: 
[Google Spreadsheet – STR Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p9Z9xxmmbTygZffQWqzsyhZH_jXCq7oI4_hybXY2XEM/edit?usp=sharing)  
- Dataset includes booking details, revenue, occupancy, and other performance metrics.

# Tools & Technologies  
Google Sheets / Excel – Data cleaning, pivot tables, formulas  

# Methodology  
1. *Data Collection** – Exported dataset from Google Sheets.  
2. *Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, standardized date formats, and handled missing values.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Used pivot tables and charts to find patterns.  
4. *Visualization** – Built dashboards tracking revenue, ADR, occupancy, and trends.  
5. *Insight Generation** – Interpreted metrics and suggested strategies.  

# Key Findings
- *Revenue Growth:** Significant revenue peaks observed in mid-year months.  
- *Occupancy Patterns:** Certain months showed lower occupancy, suggesting seasonal trends.  
- *High-Performing Units:** Some properties consistently outperformed others in ADR and occupancy.  
- *Optimization Opportunities:** Low-performing properties may benefit from revised pricing or promotions.
